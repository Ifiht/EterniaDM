This blessing has earned them the hatred of many lesser races, who either covet or misunderstand their power. So, as luck would have it, the Kismet have become masters of stealth and concealment - interacting rarely with the world; the only sign of their comings and goings is a gentle murmur of bells. 
Although similar to true dragons, the Kismet are oddly weak, making up for their physical shortcomings with a mastery of illusion and magic."

She is the mother of their kind, and the few tricks or magicks known to the lesser foxes are mere trivalities for her, she who rides on clouds and dances in the court of Kannon and Fugen. Using the kekkai traditional magicks, The Lady often stays apart from this world, living in a subdimension of her own making. Though not very strong, this ancient kitsune is terribly clever and adept at illusional magicks. In battle she is nearly impossible to hit, due to her many tails constantly whirling around her."

#era 1
#descr "Eternia is a frozen world far to the North, a throwback from ancient times when man and wolf hunted as brothers and forests still glimmered in the morning frost, without ever having known the threat of an axe. The divergence of races so common to other nations had not yet occured, and humans are just as often found as are eldritch creatures of myth and legend. The inhabitants of Eternia live in a dichotomy of forces. The land itself is in constant winter, but centered around the Eternal Flame, from which many of Eternia's inhabitants draw their strength. Creatures often have cold or flame resistance, and rarely both. Eternia lacks the diversity and fast buildup of other nations, but compensates with the overwhelming quality and skill of their combatants. The land of fire and ice, if allowed to grow, is a force to shape the world."
#summary "Race: Cold resistant, Fire resistant, few humans and mostly beasts.
Military: Primarily Skirmishers, fliers, and a solid archer corps.
Magic: Nature, FIre, Water, random paths.

Dominion: Spreads cold"

When magic dwindled and Ubar lost influence most of them dispersed and fled, but a few Marid remained, clinging to the residual magic of the Garden. Drawn to sources of magic, they are now only found in the hidden reaches of the most enchanted kingdoms.

#name "Kappa Oni"
#descr "Kappa Oni are powerful rain spirits and high priests of the kappa clans. The Kappa Oni are the ones who fill the Jugs of Heavenly Waters for the Tlaloque to let the Rain fall upon the Terrestrial Sphere. They are always accompanied by rainfalls. The Kappa has a water filled depression on the top of its head. If this water is spilled, it loses its strength. In battles on dry land, the Kappa will gain fatigue until unconscious. It is also a master of koppo, the bone-breaking technique. The Kappa is also able to mend broken bones, should it suffer injury."

#descr "The Northern generals carry bows into battle, emphasizing the hit-and-run tactics common to their race. Although men may at times join the women in battle, no huntress would ever suffer them to lead. Only the greatest female warriors rise to a high enough stature to lead their comrades, and their skill and training give them a slight combat advantage over their sisters. They carry the dryad-bows used by all Northern archer corps."

#name "Dryad"
#descr "The dryad is a powerful mountain spirit. Riding naked on a wild stag, her beauty is only lessened by her cloven feet, a trait she is immensely sensitive about. The dryad is capable of enthralling men with her beauty and spellsongs. A manifestation of nature similar ot the true dryads, she shares their healing power and aptitude for forest magic. When in battle, woodland spirits will come to her aid. Since she is a woodland spirit, the Vila shuns civilization, and may only be found in border terrirories or uncultivated areas."

#descr "The animal people lived long, long ago, when the sun was new and no larger than a star, when the earth was young, and the tall firs of the forest no larger than an arrow. The sun has grown and times have changed, but some of the mightier species still remember their heritage and learn to speak the tongues of man. Though they cannot lead, the White Wolves often use their great stealth to pass enemy lines and gather information."

They are clad in flaming golden armour, and have basic resistance to both cold and heat. Thought thier armour is inferior to nations skilled in bronze or steel, their disciplined formations and magic protection more than make up for it. Flame wardens wield short swords and carry shields."

#name "Eagle Warrior"
#descr "When man first came into the world he knew very little of it, and looked to animals to guide him. A brave few sought combat tutelage from the greater beasts, and of those the greatest were the eagles. Traveling to the highest eiries they fought and trained with flying predators twice their size. Their training culminated in a leap of faith from Boneshatter Peak, where once in the air their eagle tutor would either dive to catch them, accepting them as a brother, or let them fall. The blessing of the eagles comes with a feather-cloak to allow these wingless to fly unaided. With their flight, great swiftness, and unparalleled bravery, these few men form the strike force of the Northern armies."

#descr "In the coven of Wormwood Witches, those of lesser skill fill the rank of Wiccan. Basically servants to the Witches, they fetch herbs and brew lesser potions. Though they are not permitted to practice many true spells, their potion skills are at times remarkable. These they use to great effect on the battlefield, where they fling vials of miasmic liquid at approaching enemies. 
Special Notes: If a true Witch is present, she will draw any Wiccans into a sabbath circle, rendering them mindless and unable to attack."
